# Tiny Habits

## Key Takeaways

#### Change Behavior in Small Steps: 
Fogg's fundamental point is that rather of making large, overwhelming changes, it is more productive to begin with small, achievable habits. These little behaviors are easier to incorporate into your daily life and are more likely to succeed.

#### Emotion as a Catalyst: 
Fogg introduces the "Golden Rule of Behavior Change," which asserts that for a behavior to occur, it must have a prompt (trigger), the ability to perform the behavior, and the motivation (emotion) to perform it. Emotion is an important role in developing long-lasting behaviors.

#### Consistency trumps Intensity:
Consistency trumps intensity. According to Fogg, doing a little habit consistently is preferable to attempting a larger habit occasionally.

#### Fogg's Model for Behavior Change: 
Fogg's model for behavior change consists of three components: motivation, ability, and prompts. A behavior is likely to occur when these three elements converge. You can impact behavior modification by altering any of these elements.

* Atomic habits are so minuscule that they are almost imperceptible. This makes them far easier to achieve than large, ambitious goals. 
* According to Fogg, if you make enough small improvements, they will eventually add up to significant outcomes. He refers to this as the "compound effect."
* You can make it easier to form a habit by making the behavior smaller, the motivation stronger, or the ability simpler. It is critical to recognize and appreciate your accomplishments, no matter how minor.
